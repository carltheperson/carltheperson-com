There is something about doing hard things that is difficult to describe<span class="em-dash">—</span>a feeling you can’t quite capture. Pushing yourself when you have the constant choice not to creates a feeling of reward layered somewhere within the discomfort. It's hard to observe and appreciate but it has its own significance.

It's contradicting and defying yourself fueled by some inner feeling that you must follow through. And that act of pushing creates something distinct.


I’ve come to strongly value this feeling. There is something amazing and surreal about leaning into it.
