There is something about doing hard things that is difficult to describe<span class="em-dash">—</span>a feeling you can’t quite capture. Pushing yourself when you have the constant choice not to creates a feeling of reward layered somewhere within the discomfort. It's hard to observe and appreciate but it has its own quiet significance.

Acting in a sort of defiance against yourself<span class="em-dash">—</span>an inner tension that builds rather than breaks.

I’ve come to deeply value this feeling. There is something quite amazing about leaning into it.
