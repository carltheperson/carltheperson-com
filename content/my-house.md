# My house

On the 19 of August 2019, I bought a house with a small garden. The house is what in English apparently is called an _allotment._ Basically, a small slot meant for vegetable gardening which sometimes has a house or shed. Not really meant for living in. But after nearly a year of work, I moved into mine. It's legal as long as I don't live there all year round (I skip out on the winters). Price for the slot was 5,500$ which for a 17-year old was a pretty big investment. The cost for all the materials needed to make it liveable was about the same.

The first thing to do was to clean out all the junk and give the outside a paint job since the wood was slowly decaying in the elements.

The first thing I started on was the electrical wiring. To actually supply the house with power I had to dig a 0.5 meter deep trench from the start of the garden to the house. I did it by hand with a shovel.

Next thing to do was to insulate the walls. Here I used glass wool Blanket insulation which gave all the walls a 10 cm layer of insulation. After the insulation I put up two layers of drywall on the walls and one layer in the ceiling.

After the walls and ceiling were painted I laid down the floor with vinyl click flooring.

I then bought a bunch of second hand furniture and a kitchen. I realize I'm making it seem a lot easier than it was. It really was a ton of work. I also can't take all the credit since my parents helped me out a lot. But there you have it. The end result is a liveable (though slightly primitive) house which I absolutely love living in.

Here are some pictures of the end result.
