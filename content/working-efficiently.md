# Sorry to disappoint you in the first paragraph of this post, but I don't believe I am very good at working efficiently. By efficiently I mean getting lot's of stuff done very fast. I do however have a pretty good grasp on what works for me to increase efficiency (even if I can't always be bothered).

# I have a problem with stupid self help "do this to work better" advice. Often, it's just not practical.


For me, working inefficiently means not working at all, and working efficiently means being able to keep working in the face of distractions, uncertainty, low motivation, etc. The goal is to keep up your momentum. And that sounds easy to do in theory: just keep working, but reality is messy, and messiness gets in the way of momentum.


I want this guide to be ultra practical. Often, guides and advice like this ignore the more messy parts of reality to be more straight-forward. My stragity to avoid this is to invent a fake person (Bob), who we will be following in his work day.




Walk before you can run. Or something like that.



- Keep a list
- There is always something to do
    - Map out what you can control vs what you can’t
- Work now not later
- Intimidation is often a source of procrastinating
- Don’t get hung up on details
- Ask for help
    - Often calling someone up is the most time efficient thing to do
    - Don’t be afraid to be a bit pushy
