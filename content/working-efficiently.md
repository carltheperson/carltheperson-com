# Something 

For me, working inefficiently means not working at all, and working efficiently means being able to keep working in the face of distractions, uncertainty, low motivation, etc. The goal is to keep up your momentum. That sounds easy to do in theory: just keep working, but reality is messy, and messiness gets in the way of momentum.

I want this guide to be ultra practical. Often, guides and advice like this ignore the more messy parts of reality to be more straight-forward. My strategy to avoid this is to invent a fake person (Bob), who we will be following in his work day.

Throughout Bob's workday, I will present tangible advice that he can use to overcome his work related obstacles. 


## Meet Bob

Our fake person Bob is fresh out of school and has recently started a new remote job at FeatherTrack, a software company specializing in [Pigeon racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_racing). The company provides solutions to manage the contestants of races in real-time, and historical scoreboards that rank all pigeons from best to worst. This is Bob's dream gig.

---

He has only worked at FeatherTrack for a little over a week now, but he already feels overwhelmed. So many things are pulling at him for his attention. His manager encourages him to pick up at least three tasks a day to get up to speed. His HR person wants him to fill in their "newcomer-feelings-chart". And the security supervisor reminds him, that he has only completed 4 out of 11 security steps on his company laptop.

## Advice 1: Keep a list

This will be the most tangible of all my advice. Put the stuff you need to do in a list. 

Writing everything down in a list, allows you to stop worrying about all the things that need to be done, and start focusing on one task at a time.

Working your way down the list, crossing things off, also gives you a sense of accomplishment. There is also the convenient benefit that you can't forgot something that needs doing.

A list is nice because it summarizes the purpose of a working day into one goal, finish the list. It organizes chaos.

---

Bob makes his list:

```
[ ] Finish 3 coding tasks
[ ] Fill in HR feelings-chart
[ ] Complete security steps
```

He knows that the two last tasks aren't critical to get done today. Getting some coding done is his priority.

Bob messages the team asking if there are any tasks he can pick up. One of them answers:

> Hi Bob
> Glad you asked :) Something that desperatly needs doing is to migrate all RaceRanker's legacy AppSiteV3 DTOs to the new EggFirst format then re-index.

What? This is utter nonsence to him. It follows a tendency he has noticed recently. After becomming a familiar face in the team, people loose track of what he can reasonably know, and what he can't. As a result, he is tasked with things that make no sense to him.

He considers asking a quick followup question to the task, but in this case, he wouldn't even know what to ask. He doesn't know what he doesn't know. 

This prediciment is stressing him out. He has other tasks he needs to do today, but this one has him stuck. Why is everyone expecting him to just "pick things up"? It becomes very tempting to procrastonate the day away.

## Advice 2: There is always something you can do

You're not always expected to succeed, but you're always expected to make an effort. What's more, there is always somewhere you can direct your effort. 

Often, when we think we have no options left, it's because we're overwhelmened, and the options left are the most inconvient.

Distancing yourself from your own sittuation can help. Ask yourself, "What would a resonable person do in this sittuation?". Often, this means talking to someone who has more context than you.

---

Bob decides to call the coworker that gave him the task. It takes a while, but eventually he understands everything that was asked of him, and with a little extra help and time, he completes the task. 

Feeling the momentium from completing the last task, Bob decides to pick up a new one. The available task he finds is to create a button on FeatherTrack's website where pigeon managers can mark a race-pigeon as being retired.

Bob realizes that he doesn't quite understand how the website connects to the rest of the system. Suddenly, he gets the briliant idea of doing a deep-dive into all FeatherTrack's systems, figuring out how they each connect to each other. This would take a while, but would make the button task easier.

## Advice 3: Take the straightest path

This might be a tendency specific to me and Bob, but we tend to overprepare for a task instead of jumping straight into it. This is a form of procrastination that disguise itself as preparedness.

Doing open-ended research into your area of work is a good idea, but not when you have a specific thing you're trying to accomplish. You risk spending valuable time teaching yourself concepts that don't apply to what you need. And while these concepts might become useful later, this is not guaranteed.

When you have the time, I highly recommend diving into rabbit holes, but when you have a concrete goal, it's best to take the straightest path.

---

Bob decides to research only the systems relevant to the button, and starts making solid progress, when he suddenly encounters a dilemma. The designs he's using are incomplete. It's very clear how the button should look for a non-retired pigeon, but what if a pigeon is *already* retired? Should it be possible to un-retire a pigeon? If so, how should *that* button look? This is unclear to Bob. 

He knows the designer often takes long to respond to messages. Maybe it's best to just make an educated guess about the button, so he can finish his task quicker?

## Advice 4: Face the inevitable now

A lot of working time is spent re-doing old work because it was done wrongly. This is in many cases unavoidable, but sometimes it's easily preventable with some extra consideration.

Especially when encountering dilemmas, we tend to be overly opimistic in our ability to predict the future. This causes us to take shortcuts in the form of hasty descions, avoiding the trouble of getting more clarity. But facing a hard dilemma now, is much better than later on, when it inevitably will come into question again.

---

Bob calls the designer to ask how the button should work/look for already retired pigeons. He learns that pigeons *can* be un-retired, and the designer sends over some new designs for him to implement.

After implementing the button, Bob is tired. He knows he should finish another task, but at this point, he'd much rather rest. He considers stopping for now, and waking up early tomorrow to finsih the last task.

## Advice 5: Work now not later

When doing something difficult, it's far too easy convincing yourself that it would be better to work later rather than now. Of course, there are times when it's fully resonable push off work to rest early, but often, you convince yourself to quit, when it's smarter to push on some more. Putting off work can risk it piling up, which leads to more stress. A general rule of thumb is that it's better to work now, not later. 

Ideally, to avoid procastination you shouldn't let yourself stop working without planning when in advance. Planning ahead also solves the complication of breaks. Breaks are necessary, but they should be planned, e.g. 10 minutes every hour.

Stoping work to relax feels much more satisfying, when you know it's fully justified and planned.

there is no concrete task, Bob asks his boss, he tells him, study this etc. 

## Advice 6: Time-define boundless tasks

## Advice 7: Have a brutal growth mindset 

I have to tread a fine line here between useful advice and obscure self-help nonsense.

"Growth mindset" is often thrown around by anyoing people as a simple solution to guaranteed success.

- He considers just picking an option to get done faster
- He doesn't, and instead asks the designer.
- He has one task left, he considers doing it the text day and relaxing now.
- "Work now not later"


- Advice 3: Take the straightest path
- Advice 4: Face the inevitable
- Advice 5: Work now not later


New:
- Have a brutal growth mindset
- Time-define boundless tasks




FeatherTrack tech:

- Each Pigeon has an id, the PID
- The RaceRanker has the real-time aspect
- AppSiteV3 is the UI





Walk before you can run. Or something like that.



- Keep a list
- There is always something you can do
    - Map out what you can control vs what you can’t
- Work now not later
- Intimidation is often a source of procrastinating
- Don’t get hung up on details
- Ask for help
    - Often calling someone up is the most time efficient thing to do
    - Don’t be afraid to be a bit pushy

- Perferction, can prevent you from doing a task whatever
